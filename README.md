06-hw-server-side-APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Contents
<p>
This Weather Dashboard is composed of 3 pages: index.html, script.js and style.css. The folder also includes some images of the application.
</p>

## User Story
<p>
The purpose of this project was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The app uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as a third-party API to retrieve weather data for cities. Local storage is used to store any persistent data.
</p> 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
